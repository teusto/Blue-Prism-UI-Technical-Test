## FAQ

#### What would I do with more time?

I would like to focus on these points:
- Documentation about css class and components, basically document everything so any other developer would have a easy time understanding what was made.
- Test more components and maybe config a e2e test also.
- Define more types and interfaces
- Would like to implement some animations to make the design more fluid and appealing(using gsap, framer, etc).
- Dockerize the app.
